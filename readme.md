Password Generator

In this pass word generator the user is asked to confirm different parameters for the generator. The parameters are "special characters", "numeric characters", "lowercase characters" and "uppercase characters". After the parameters are chosen the user is asked how many characters they want the password to be. The password must be between 8 and 128 characters.

Things that could be improved:
1: ensure that 1  of each type is output
2: add copry to clipboard button
